# RBAC Project

## Description
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions and access within an application. It allows administrators to assign roles to users and define specific permissions for each role, enabling fine-grained access control over different sections of the application.

## Features
- User authentication and registration
- Role creation and management
- Permission assignment per role
- Access control based on user roles and permissions
- Admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions
- API endpoints for user-role and permission management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/nandha2804/RBAC.git
   cd RBAC

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Access the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

3. To access the admin dashboard, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   ```
Tests are written using the Django testing framework (or relevant framework used).
